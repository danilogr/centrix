The goal of this project was to have a draft operating system in  Protected Mode. Unfortunately, I never implemented task and task switching. Nevertheless, I learned a lot about computer architecture and operating systems because of this project. 

It's important to mention that a lot of resources were quite useful and made this project possible:

By the way, back in 2007, I was a high school student with no formal training in Computer Science. Also, I had a computer with a floppy drive, and I only tested the two-stage bootloader with floppy disks.
